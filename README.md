# Accommodation Management System

    A C project to aid accommodation management .
  
  The application has three different implementations in array , in Linked List and in B+ Trees each .  

The idea for three implemenations is to study the actions like Insertion of Record , it's updation , it's deletion and it's display using all the three data structures mentioned above.  

Some more complex operations like printing the sorted records (using indexing), special request allocation/deallocation of accommodation type, removing duplicate entries if any, search, range search and address search were also implemented.

The respective problem statements and implementations can be found in the above folders .
